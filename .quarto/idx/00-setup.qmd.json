Just know that we may be less able to help you and troubleshoot if you deviate from the recommended workflow.\n\nFor grading consistency, we **will** require that you submit `quarto`-rendered documents for all labs and projects.\n\n## Computer Basics\n\nIt is helpful when teaching a topic as technical as programming to ensure that everyone starts from the same basic foundational understanding and mental model of how things work. When teaching geology, for instance, the instructor should probably make sure that everyone understands that the earth is a round ball and not a flat plate -- it will save everyone some time later.\n\nWe all use computers daily - we carry them around with us on our wrists, in our pockets, and in our backpacks. This is no guarantee, however, that we understand how they work or what makes them go.\n\n### Hardware\n\nHere is a short 3-minute video on the basic hardware that makes up your computer. It is focused on desktops, but the same components (with the exception of the optical drive) are commonly found in cell phones, smart watches, and laptops.\n\n:::{.callout-learn-more .icon}\n\n{{ <video \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rdm8E59L8Og >}}\n\n:::\n\nWhen programming, it is usually helpful to understand the distinction between RAM and disk storage (hard drives). We also need to know at least a little bit about processors (so that we know when we've asked our processor to do too much). Most of the other details aren't necessary (for now).\n\n<!-- ::: learn-more -->\n\n<!-- -   [Chapter 1 of Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/html3/01-intro) - Computer hardware architecture -->\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n### Operating Systems\n\nOperating systems, such as Windows, MacOS, or Linux, are a sophisticated program that allows CPUs to keep track of multiple programs and tasks and execute them at the same time.\n\n:::{.callout-learn-more .icon}\n{{ <video https://www.youtube.com/embed/RhHMgkUdhdk\" > }}\n:::\n\n### File Systems {#file-systems}\n\nEvidently, there has been a bit of generational shift as computers have evolved: the \"file system\" metaphor itself is outdated because no one uses physical files anymore. [This article](https://futurism.com/the-byte/gen-z-kids-file-systems) is an interesting discussion of the problem: it makes the argument that with modern search capabilities, most people use their computers as a laundry hamper instead of as a nice, organized filing cabinet.\n\n![](https://i.redd.it/1m9l0op71go21.png){width=80% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nRegardless of how you tend to organize your personal files, it is probably helpful to understand the basics of what is meant by a computer **file system** -- a way to organize data stored on a hard drive. Since data is always stored as 0's and 1's, it's important to have some way to figure out what type of data is stored in a specific location, and how to interpret it.\n\n:::{.callout-required-video .icon}\n\n{{ <video https://www.youtube.com/embed/BV0-EPUYuQc >}}\n\nStop watching at 4:16.\n:::\n\nThat's not enough, though - we also need to know how computers remember the location of what is stored where. Specifically, we need to understand **file paths**.\n\n:::{.callout-required-video .icon}\n{{ <video https://www.youtube.com/embed/BMT3JUWmqYY >}}\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n:::{.callout-opinion .icon collapse=\"true\"}\nRecommend watching - helpful for understanding file paths!\n:::\n\n\nWhen you write a program, you may have to reference external files - data stored in a .csv file, for instance, or a picture. Best practice is to create a file structure that contains everything you need to run your entire project in a single file folder (you can, and sometimes should, have sub-folders).\n\nFor now, it is enough to know how to find files using file paths, and how to refer to a file using a relative file path from your base folder. In this situation, your \"base folder\" is known as your **working directory** - the place your program thinks of as home.\n\n## Git and GitHub\n\nOne of the most important parts of a data scientist's workflow is **version tracking**: the process of making sure that you have a record of the changes and updates you have made to your code.\n\n### Git\n\n**Git** is a computer program that lives on your local \ncomputer. Once you designate a folder as a **Git Repository**, the program will automatically tracks changes to the files in side that folder.  \n\n:::{.callout-check-in .icon}\n[Click here to install Git on your computer.](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n:::\n\n### GitHub\n\n**GitHub**, and the less used alternate **GitLab**, are websites where *Git Repositories* can be stored online.  This is useful for sharing your repository (\"repo\") with others, for multiple people collaborating on the same repository, and for yourself to be able to access your files from anywhere.\n\n:::{.callout-check-in .icon}\n[Click here to make a GitHub account](www.github.com), if you do not already have one.\n\nYou do **not** have to use your school email for this account.\n:::\n\n### Practice with Repos\n\nIf you are already familiar with how to use Git and GitHub, you can skip the rest of this section, which will walk us through some practice making and editing repositories.\n\nFirst, watch this 15-minute video, which nicely illustrates the basics of version tracking:\n\n:::{.callout-required-video .icon}\n{{ <video https://www.youtube.com/embed/BCQHnlnPusY?si=L9C5waHxDzib-VwY >}}\n:::\n\nThen, watch this 10-minute video, which introduces the idea of **branches**, and important habit for collaborating with others (or your future self!)\n\n:::{.callout-required-video .icon}\n{{ <video https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPpnCh7InLY?si=Yzezgt3R4n1OYBdV >}}\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-opinion .icon collapse=\"true\"}\nAlthough Git can sometimes be a headache, it is worth the struggle.  Never again will you have to deal with a folder full of documents that looks like:\n\n```\nProject-Final\nProject-Final-1\nProject-Final-again\nProject-Final-1-1\nProject-Final-for-real\n```\n:::\n\nWorking with Git and GitHub can be made a lot easier by helper tools and apps.  We recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for your committing and pushing.\n\n### Summary\n\nFor our purposes, it will be sufficient for you to learn to:\n\n* **commit** your work frequently as you make progress; about as often as you might *save* a document\n\n* **push** your work every time you step away from your project\n\n* **branch** your repo when you want to try something and you aren't sure it will work.\n\n\nIt will probably take you some time to get used to a workflow that feels natural to you - that's okay!  As long as you are trying out version control, you're doing great.\n\n![](https://i.redd.it/0cxiwyvthgc61.png){width=80% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Anaconda and Jupyter\n\nNow, let's talk about getting python actually set up and running.\n\n![](https://i.redd.it/d28emc32q6271.png){width=80% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Anaconda\n\nOne downside of `python` is that it can sometimes be complicated to keep track of installs and updates.\n\n![](https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_1794625_EDg9q.jpg){width=80% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n\nUnless you already have a `python` environment setup that works for you, we will suggest that you use **Anaconda**, which bundles together an installation of the most recent `python` version as well as multiple tools for interacting with the code.\n\n:::{.callout-check-in .icon}\n[Download Anaconda here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)\n:::\n\n\n### Jupyter\n\nWhen you are writing ordinary text, you choose what type of document to use - Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LaTeX, etc.\n\nSimilarly, there are many types of files where you can write `python` code.  By far the most common and popular is the `jupyter` notebook.\n\nThe advantage of a `jupyter` notebook is that ordinary text and \"chunks\" of code can be interspersed.\n\n![](https://jupyter-dashboards-layout.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/notebook.png){width=80% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nJupyter notebooks have the file extension `.ipynb` for \"i python notebook\".\n\n#### Google Colab\n\nOne way you may have seen the Jupyter notebooks before is on Google's free cloud service, [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n\n:::{.callout-practice-exercise .icon}\n\nOpen up [this colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Lq8ccz71GJAIb9MZmxQMgr9mm1gY4dXp?usp=sharing) and make a copy.\n\nFill out the sections where indicated, to practice using Jupyter notebooks.\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-opinion .icon collapse=\"true\"}\n\nColab is an amazing data science tool that allows for easy collaboration.\n\nHowever, there is a limited amount of free compute time offered by Google, and not as much flexibility or control over the documents.\n\nThis is why we need Anaconda or similar local installations.\n\n:::\n\n## Quarto\n\nAlthough jupyter and Colab are fantastic tools for data analysis, one major limitation is that the raw notebooks themselves are not the same as a final clear report.\n\nTo convert our interactive notebooks into professionally presented static documents, we will use a program called `Quarto`.\n\n:::{.callout-check-in .icon}\n[Download Quarto here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)\n:::\n\nOnce quarto is installed, converting a `.ipynb` file \nrequires running only a single line in the *Terminal*:\n\n```\nquarto render my_file.ipynb\n```\n\n:::{.callout-check-in .icon}\nDownload the .ipynb file from your practice Colab notebook, open it using Anaconda, and render it using Quarto. \n:::\n\nHowever, there are also many, many options to make the final rendered document look even more visually pleasing and professional.
